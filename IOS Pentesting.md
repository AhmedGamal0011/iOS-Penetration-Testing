Correlium: iOS emulator

xcode: for debug the code with IPA file
test flight : method to share apps for testing

you can't run IPA direct on Xcode without credit from Apple as a iOS developer, instead of that the client can share IPA with test flight.

you can reverse IPA file with GHIDRA or IDA or Hobber Disassembler [30 min Demo] tools.

any sub in reverse tool means function.

To decompile ipa file 

```
unzip app.ipa
```

MobSF

Info.plist : This file holds specific configuration details of the application.

otool: tool for reverse binary
```
// for more info about the binary
otool -l VLC\ for\ iOS
```

You can **dump** the information saved using `**NSUserDefaults**` using objection's `ios nsuserdefaults get`

You can find the SQLite Core Data information of an application in the path `/private/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/{APPID}/Library/Application Support`

```
idevice_id --list   # To find the device ID
idevicesyslog -u <id> (| grep <app>)   # To capture the device logs
```

Cydia : tool to install any packages.
Newterm: terminal for iOS device.
Filza file manager: to list all directories and files of app.
Cycript: tool for dynamic analysis. you can install it from packages at Search tab.

To extract an ipa file from application go to /var/containers/Bundle/Application , then copy the application file that contains all app data, and paste on a folder name "Payload" that you created at Downloads or Documents. then make a zip file from the folder and rename it to "app.ipa".

To Connect ssh from ios to Mac, download openssh on ios device.

To download the ipa file from ios to mac desktop use
```
scp root@IP:/User/Documents/VLC105.ipa .
```

app for iOS is the executable file. the file you need to analysis. you can do this with GHIDRA or IDA or Hopper Disassembler

to list the ipa file content:

```
unzip app.ipa
```

To install unverified apps like DVIAv2 you need to write a repo at "Sources", cydia.akemi.ai
then go to search tab and download AppSync Unified.
